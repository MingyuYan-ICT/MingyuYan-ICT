[Jan. 2018] **Hardware Architecture for Graph Processing.**
- To fully alleviate the irregularities at their origin---the data-dependent program behavior, we propose GraphDynS, a hardware/software co-design with decoupled datapath and data-aware dynamic scheduling. Aware of data dependencies extracted from the decoupled datapath, GraphDynS can elaborately schedule the program on-the-fly to maximize parallelism.

[Oct. 2018] **Hardware Architecture for Graph Neural Network.**
- We first characterize the hybrid execution patterns of GCNs on Intel Xeon CPU. Guided by the characterization, we design a GCN accelerator, HyGCN, using a hybrid architecture to efficiently perform GCNs. In addition, we first identify the communication pattern and challenges of multi-node acceleration for GCNs on large-scale graphs. Guided by the above observations, we then propose MultiGCN, an efficient MultiAccSys for large-scale GCNs that trades network latency for network bandwidth.
